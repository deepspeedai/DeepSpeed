# DeepSpeed Documentation

This directory includes the documentation of DeepSpeed. There are three ways to read it:

## 1. Access [deepspeed.ai](https://www.deepspeed.ai/)

This is the recommended way to read the documentation.

## 2. Build [deepspeed.ai](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) locally


### Installing Ruby
You

```
export GEM_HOME="$HOME/gems"
export PATH="$HOME/gems/bin:$PATH"
```

First ensure that you have the necessary packages (e.g., `make` and `zlib`). On Ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev ruby-dev
```

### Installing Ruby
Next, install the required Ruby packages:
```
bundle install
```

### Start a local webserver
```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
The website should now be visible at [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

This is recommended for local website development or when you do not have internet access. You can follow the instruction at [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) to install Ruby, Bundler, and Jekyll. Then run `bundle exec jekyll serve` at this directory so that you can view the website in your web browser at `http://localhost:4000`.

apt-get install build-essential zlib1g-dev ruby-dev
RUBY HOME
bundle install


## 3. Directly read files in this directory

We do not recommend this way because this directory is organized to build the [deepspeed.ai](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) website using Jekyll. Thus some of the files actually are not DeepSpeed documentation. In addition, some of the url links in the documentation only work through the webpages generated by Jekyll.
