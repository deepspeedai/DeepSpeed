# DeepSpeed Documentation

This directory includes the documentation of DeepSpeed. There are three ways to read it:

## 1. Access [deepspeed.ai](https://www.deepspeed.ai/)

This is the most recommended way to read the documentation.

## 2. Directly read files in this directory

We do not recommend this way because this directory is organized to build the [deepspeed.ai](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) website using Jekyll. Thus some of the files actually are not DeepSpeed documentation. In addition, some of the url links in the documentation only work through the webpages generated by Jekyll.

## 3. Build [deepspeed.ai](https://www.deepspeed.ai/) website locally using Jekyll

This is recommended for local website development or when you do not have internet access. You can follow the instruction at [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll) to install Ruby, Bundler, and Jekyll. Then run `bundle exec jekyll serve` at this directory so that you can view the website in your web browser at `http://localhost:4000`.
