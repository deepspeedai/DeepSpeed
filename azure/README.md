# DeepSpeed with Azure

This tutorial will help you get started running DeepSpeed on [Azure VMs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/virtual-machines/), support for [Azure ML](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/machine-learning/) will be coming soon!

To help with launching Azure instances we suggest using the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/?view=azure-cli-latest). We have created several helper scripts to get you quickly started using DeepSpeed with Azure.
